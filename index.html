		         <p class="paragraph">The oceans are fundamental to life as we know it on this planet, covering 70% of Earth’s land area. While many of us associate oceans with beauty and leisure, they actually play many critical planetary functions.</p>
		         <h5 class="headtext-3 sm-margin">Functions of Ocean</h5>
		         <ul class="lists">
		             <li>Plankton and aquatic plants in the ocean provide 50% of the oxygen we use to breathe and live.</li>
		             <li>The ocean is a crucial part of our global weather, climate and temperature regulations systems. 98% of the 		         	  heat from the sun is absorbed by the Ocean. This heat is then moved around the earth via currents.</li>
		             <li>The ocean is a crucial source of food for people and animals. The Ocean provides protein to nearly 3 billion 	         	   humans every year.</li>

			   <p class="paragraph">Sunway Group’s four pillars of sustainability are outlined based on the 17 goals under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG). This SDG focuses on developing and expanding renewable energy resources such as sun, wind, hydropower, liquid and solid biofuels, biogas and geothermal. These renewable sources of energy do not emit greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and are therefore ideal for the environment and human health. </p>
			   <h2 class="headtext-2 sm-margin">Our goals</h2>
			   <ul class="lists">
			      <li>14.1 By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution</li>
			      <li>14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans</li>
			      <li>14.3 Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels</li>
			      <li>14.4 By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics</li>
			      <li>14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information</li>
			      <li>14.6 By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation</li>
			      <li>14.7 By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism</li>
			      <li>14.A Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries</li>
			      <li>14.B Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets</li>
			      <li>14.C Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in UNCLOS, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of The Future We Want</li>
